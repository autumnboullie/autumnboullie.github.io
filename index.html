    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>There is not one bucket that has tubes that leads to two other buckets that eventually lead out the black box.</p>
    <h1> Evidence </h1>
    <p>The initial black box had a funnel sticking out the top and a tube sticking out the bottom of the box and random amounts of water came out of the box no matter how much water we put in. For example we put in 1500 ml of water and 1725 ml water came out. We built a model with three buckets connected by tubes and the first bucket was the receiving bucket where the water sat when it came in and during our first trial we got no water that came out, but every trial after that we had less water come out than what we put in. </p>
